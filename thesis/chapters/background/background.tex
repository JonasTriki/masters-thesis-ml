\chapter{Background}
In this chapter, we introduce and explain the technical and theoretical background of this thesis. In particular, we introduce general methods from machine learning, the notion of word embeddings and topological data analysis and methods from its field. We describe concepts to the point where they are understandable for the sake of the thesis, but leave out technical details of concepts that are not in focus (e.g. intrinsic dimension estimation in \cref{sec:intrinsic-dimension-estimation}). On the other hand, we have some particular concepts which we have worked with more extensively throughout the thesis, such as clustering (\cref{sec:clustering-algorithms,sec:cluster-validation}), word embeddings (\cref{sec:word-embeddings}) and topological data analysis (\cref{sec:topological-data-analysis}). We give a thorough explanation of such concepts. Finally, we assume that the reader is familiar with general concepts from calculus, linear algebra and statistics. Following, we introduce and explain the technical and theoretical background of this thesis.
