\chapter{Background}
In this chapter, we will introduce and explain the technical and theoretical background required for this master thesis. In particular, we will introduce general methods from machine learning, introduce the notion of word embeddings and introduce topological data analysis and methods from the field. We will introduce and describe concepts to the point where they are understandable for the sake of the master thesis, but for some particular concepts (e.g. intrinsic dimension estimation), we leave out technical details as they are not the focus of the thesis. Particular concepts, such as clustering (\cref{sec:clustering-algorithms,sec:cluster-validation}), word embeddings (\cref{sec:word-embeddings}) and topological data analysis (\cref{sec:topological-data-analysis}) have been worked with more extensively than other concepts and therefore requires a deeper explanation. Finally, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with general concepts from calculus, linear algebra and statistics. We will now introduce and explain the technical and theoretical background of this master thesis.
