\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}
In this chapter, we will introduce and explain the technical and theoretical background of this thesis. In particular, we will introduce general methods from machine learning, the notion of word embeddings, and topological data analysis (TDA) and methods from its field. We will describe concepts to the point where they are understandable for the sake of the thesis, but leave out technical details of concepts that are not in focus (e.g. intrinsic dimension estimation in \cref{sec:intrinsic-dimension-estimation}). On the other hand, we have some particular concepts which we have worked with more extensively throughout the thesis, such as clustering (\cref{sec:clustering-algorithms,sec:cluster-validation}), word embeddings (\cref{sec:word-embeddings}), and TDA (\cref{sec:topological-data-analysis}). Thus, we will give a thorough explanation of these concepts. Finally, we assume that the reader is familiar with general concepts from calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. In the following sections, we will introduce and explain the technical and theoretical background of this thesis.
