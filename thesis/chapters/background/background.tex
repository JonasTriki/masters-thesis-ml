\chapter{Background}
In this chapter, we will introduce and explain the technical and theoretical background required for this master thesis. In particular, we will introduce general methods from machine learning, introduce the notion of word embeddings and introduce topological data analysis and methods from the field. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with general concepts from linear algebra and statistics.

\textbf{TODO}:
Mention what I have worked much with (word embeddings, clustering, TPS, GAD) and what I have worked less with (ID estimation, only referred to).
