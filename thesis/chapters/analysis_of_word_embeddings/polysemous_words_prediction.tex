\section{Polysemous words prediction}
\label{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-tda}
In this section, we try to predict whether or not a word is polysemous, given its word vector. We will, first, apply methods from topological data analysis to word embeddings. In particular, we will investigate the notion of topological polysemy (\cref{sec:topological-polysemy}) and geometric anomaly detection (\cref{sec:geometric-anomaly-detection}). We use topological polysemy to attempt to estimate the number of meanings of a word, given its word vector; we would like to see if the $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ score actually measures polysemy. In addition to this, we would like to see if singular word vectors, as identified by geometric anomaly detection, are polysemous as well. Following, we compute the estimated intrinsic dimension of word embeddings are compare the results with the number of word meanings. Finally, we propose supervised models to predict the number of word meanings.

\subsection{Topological polysemy}
\label{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-topological-polysemy}
In this subsection, we apply topological polysemy (\cref{sec:topological-polysemy}) to the word embeddings from SGNS-enwiki. We will also train another word2vec model using the same training data used by \cite{jakubowski2020topology} and apply topological polysemy to its word embeddings. We refer to this word2vec model as the \textit{SGNS-semeval} model. Furthermore, we compare the results to topological polysemy applied to word embeddings from pre-trained models, namely the fastText model (\textit{fastText.TPS.300d}) used in experiments of \cite{jakubowski2020topology}, the \textit{GoogleNews-vectors-negative300} (shortened to \textit{GoogleNews300}) word embeddings from \cite{GoogleCodeArchiveWord2vec}, the \textit{glove.840B.300d} word embeddings from \cite{GloVeProject2014} and the English (\textit{fastText.en.300d}) word embeddings from \cite{grave2018learning}. The fastText.TPS.300d model was kindly given in private communication with one of the authors of topological polysemy \cite{ZibrowiusPrivComs2021}.

The authors of topological polysemy, \cite{jakubowski2020topology}, trained a fastText model on training data from the \textit{SemEval-2010 Task 14: Evaluation Setting for Word Sense Induction \& Disambiguation Systems} \cite{manandhar-klapaftis-2009-semeval}. The training data from the SemEval task consists of several sentences related to 100 polysemous words (50 nouns and 50 verbs). The SemEval data set also includes the number of true meanings (also called \textit{gold standard} or \textit{GS}) for each of the 100 polysemous words, as perceived by humans. In private communication with one of the authors of topological polysemy \cite{ZibrowiusPrivComs2021}, they stated that they used a fastText model with vector dimensionality of 300, and to process the training data, they removed all punctuation and replaced capital letters by the corresponding small letters. To compare with the $\text{TPS}_n(w)$, the authors use the 100 polysemous words, words from the SemEval training data which has a \textit{WordNet} \cite{fellbaum1998} entry and all words in SemEval training data. WordNet is a lexical database of the English language. In particular, it allows for querying nearly any word from the English language and and returns the \textit{synsets} of the word. Synsets of a query word $w$ is a collection of words which have similar meaning as the word $w$. In other words, by querying a word in WordNet, we can get the number of meanings of a word, as perceived by WordNet. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient \cite{James2013} is computed between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and GS, the number of synsets for WordNet words and the word frequency as they appear in the SemEval training data, respectively. The authors show that there is a moderate (positive) correlation between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and GS at $n \in \enclc{40, 50, 60}$, a decreasing correlation between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and the number of synsets for WordNet words and no correlation between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and word frequencies. In our implementation of topological polysemy, we utilized multiprocessing and the ScaNN \cite{scann2020} approximate nearest neighbour algorithm to speed up the computation. We used the \path{ripser} \cite{ctralie2018ripser} Python package to compute Vietorisâ€“Rips complexes. \textbf{TODO}: Ripser or Gudhi?

We trained the SGNS-semeval model using the training data from the SemEval task and the hyperparameters used to train the SGNS-enwiki model from \cref{sec:word2vec-hyperparameter-choices}. This resulted in a vocabulary size of $\sim$122K words and corpus size of $\sim$67 million for the SGNS-enwiki model. Following, we will compare the results from the experiments of \cite{jakubowski2020topology} by computing topological polysemy at varying levels of $n$ using the word embeddings of SGNS-enwiki and SGNS-semeval. Finally, we compare the results using the SGNS-enwiki and SGNS-semeval word embeddings to the word embeddings of the fastText.TPS.300d, GoogleNews300, glove.840B.300d and fastText.en.300d models.

The results of computing topological polysemy at varying levels of $n$ using the word embeddings of SGNS-enwiki and SGNS-semeval are shown in \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-sgns-enwiki,table:tps-n-correlation-sgns-semeval}. From \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-sgns-enwiki}, we see that the correlation between $\text{TPS}_n$ and GS is rather stable with respect to $n$. In particular, we notice that the correlation between $\text{TPS}_n$ and GS is negative, suggesting a relationship in the opposite direction of the results from \cite[Table 1]{jakubowski2020topology}. Nonetheless, we see a decreasing correlation when comparing $\text{TPS}_n$ versus the number of WordNet synsets for each word, and a negligible correlation between $\text{TPS}_n$ and word frequencies of the top 10000 most common words. Furthermore, from \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-sgns-semeval}, we observe a decreasing negative correlation (towards zero) between $\text{TPS}_n$ and GS, meaning that the SGNS-semeval model performs worse than the SGNS-enwiki model on this particular task. This may indicate that by training SGNS-semeval on a smaller vocabulary than the vocabulary of SGNS-enwiki we get worse results. Furthermore, we see a a decreasing correlation between $\text{TPS}_n$ and the number of WordNet synsets and a negligible correlation between $\text{TPS}_n$ and word frequencies of the top 10000 most common words. Although the negative correlation between $\text{TPS}_n$ and the number of WordNet synsets is larger for the SGNS-semeval model than the SGNS-enwiki model, it is still not particularly large. In addition to this, we are considering a lot fewer words when computing the correlation in the SGNS-semeval model than the SGNS-enwiki model (see sample size).

\end{table}

To further broaden our understanding of the results from computing topological polysemy of the word embeddings of the SGNS-enwiki and the SGNS-semeval model, we plot $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ against the GS, the number of WordNet synsets and word frequencies, as shown in \cref{fig:tps-n-correlation-sgns-enwiki,fig:tps-n-correlation-sgns-semeval}. For each plot, we let $n$ be equal to the most optimal value for each column in \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-sgns-enwiki,table:tps-n-correlation-sgns-semeval}. From \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-sgns-enwiki}, we see a similar situation to the results from \cite[Figures 8 and 9]{jakubowski2020topology}, namely that in plot (a) we see an indication of a linear relationship between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and the SemEval gold standard and in plot (b) we see a clear trend between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and the number of synsets in WordNet. In plot (c) it is clear that there is no apparent relationship between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and the word frequencies. Following, we see a similar situation appearing in \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-sgns-enwiki}. These results suggest that, even by computing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ of the SGNS-enwiki word embeddings, which has a vocabulary much larger than in the experiments of \cite{jakubowski2020topology}, we are unable to use $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ alone for predicting the number of word meanings, as given by the number of WordNet synsets.

Following, we compare the results of computing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ of the word embeddings of the SGNS-enwiki and SGNS-semeval models to the word embeddings of the fastText.TPS.300d, GoogleNews300, glove.840B.300d and fastText.en.300d models. The $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ results of using the fastText.TPS.300d model are shown in \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-fasttext-tps-word-embeddings}, and using the GoogleNews300, glove.840B.300d and fastText.en.300d models are shown in \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-external-word-embeddings}. We do not compute the correlation between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and word frequencies in \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-fasttext-tps-word-embeddings,table:tps-n-correlation-external-word-embeddings}, since we do not have the data available. In addition to this, it is unlikely that $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and word frequencies have anything in common, as show in the previous results using the SGNS-enwiki and SGNS-semeval models, as well as by the experiments of \cite{jakubowski2020topology}. From \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-fasttext-tps-word-embeddings}, we see similar results to the experiments of \cite{jakubowski2020topology}, namely that we get a modest, positive correlation when comparing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ to the SemEval gold standard, and that we get a decreasing correlation when comparing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ to the number of WordNet synsets. We note, however, that we do not get the exact same correlation results as \cite{jakubowski2020topology}; this could be affected by the use of ScaNN to approximate the nearest neighbours. Furthermore, from \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-external-word-embeddings} we see that the GoogleNews300 models yields particularly high values when comparing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ to the SemEval gold standard, while the remaining models are modest at best. We also observe that when comparing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ to the number of WordNet synsets, we do not get high correlation scores. This further suggests that by only increasing the vocabulary of the word embedding model, we are not able to model the number of WordNet synsets very well, by only using the $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ scores. Additionally, the unstable correlation results shown in \cref{table:tps-n-correlation-external-word-embeddings} indicate that the $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ scores are behaving rather randomly, and it is not clear if $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ measures polysemy of words.

To compare how well the various word embedding models agree on the $\text{TPS}_n(w)$, we will create a correlation matrix by comparing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and the SemEval gold standard. Using a correlation matrix, we summarize the results nicely and further deepen our understanding of the results. By majority vote, we will let $n=40$ when comparing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and the SemEval gold standard. The correlation matrix is shown in \cref{fig:correlation-matrix-tps-vs-gs}. From \cref{fig:correlation-matrix-tps-vs-gs}, we see that the SGNS-enwiki, SGNS-semeval and GoogleNews300 models yield similar $\text{TPS}_{40}(w)$ results. We also note that the fastText.TPS.300d model either yield no correlation (approximately equal to zero) or negative correlations, when compared to the other models.

\end{figure}

To deepen the understanding, we visualize the similarity of the SGNS-enwiki, SGNS-semeval and GoogleNews300 models in \cref{fig:tps-vs-gs-top-3-correlation-word-embedding-models}, where we can see linear relationships appearing. These results suggest that the SGNS-enwiki, SGNS-semeval and GoogleNews300 models agree on how to score using $\text{TPS}_{40}(w)$.

Following, we look at the three negative correlations from \cref{fig:correlation-matrix-tps-vs-gs} and visualize the negative relationships in \cref{fig:tps-vs-gs-top-3-negative-correlation-word-embedding-models}. From \cref{fig:tps-vs-gs-top-3-negative-correlation-word-embedding-models}, we see negative relationships appearing, although it is less significant than the positive relationships seen in \cref{fig:tps-vs-gs-top-3-correlation-word-embedding-models}.

We have now looked at the effect of computing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ at varying levels of $n$ using various word embeddings. We saw that, even by decreasing/increasing the vocabulary size of the word embedding models, the $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ score did not improve significantly. In all our experiments (except using the fastText.TPS.300d model), the correlation between $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ and the SemEval gold standard were always negative, while in the experiments of \cite{jakubowski2020topology}, they got a moderate, positive correlation. This suggests that the topological polysemy scoring could be affected by choice of word embedding model (i.e. choosing fastText over word2vec) and the fact that the model used in \cite{jakubowski2020topology} was trained on a data set which is strongly related to the 100 polysemous words. In other words, it could seem that the measure of topological polysemy does not work well, for a general word embedding model.

To deepen our understanding of how the $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ is computed, we will perform an experiment by computing $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ of a custom data set. The custom data set consists of sampled data points of two spheres which share one intersection point. We denote this data set as \textit{2Spheres-$d$}, where $d$ represents the dimensionality of the spheres. In particular, we let $d \in \enclc{2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 300}$. To ensure that the dimensionality of the \textit{2Spheres-$d$} data set is similar to the dimensionality of word embeddings, we let the dimensionality of the space be equal to 300, i.e. \textit{2Spheres-$d$} $\in \R^{300}$. In other words, if $d$ was less than 300, we simply add zeros to the remaining dimensions to fill up to 300. For each sphere in \textit{2Spheres-$d$}, we generate 1000000 points on the sphere in $\R^d$. We sort the points by distance to the intersection point and further split the points into 20 intervals, i.e. chunks of 100000 data points for each sphere. Next, we sample 1000 points from each interval, leading to 20000 points for each sphere. The motivation for sampling from distance sorted intervals is to reduce the effect of the curse of dimensionality, namely that it becomes harder to measure the distance between points in high (e.g. 300) dimension. For the sake of simplicity, we let $n=50$ when computing the topological polysemy. We illustrate the result of computing $\text{TPS}_{50}$ of 2Spheres-$2$ and 2Spheres-$3$ in \cref{fig:two-spheres-2d-3d-tps-scores}. From \cref{fig:two-spheres-2d-3d-tps-scores}, we see that for both 2Spheres-$2$ and 2Spheres-$3$, the $\text{TPS}_{50}$ is at its highest (yellow color) around the intersection point between the two spheres (see plots (b) and (d)). In addition to this, at the intersection point between the two spheres, the $\text{TPS}_{50}$ score is low. These two observations suggest that, for low values of $d$, $\text{TPS}_{50}$ fails to identify the singular point, but rather manages to identify the area around it. We will now look at how the $\text{TPS}_{50}$ score behaves for $d \in \enclc{4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 300}$.

    \label{fig:two-spheres-2d-3d-tps-scores}
\end{figure}

We visualize the result of computing $\text{TPS}_{50}$ for 2Spheres-$d$ for $d \in \enclc{4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 300}$ in \cref{fig:two-spheres-distance-to-int-point-vs-tps-scores}, by plotting the distance to intersection point between the spheres against the $\text{TPS}_{50}$ score. From \cref{fig:two-spheres-distance-to-int-point-vs-tps-scores}, we see that as the dimension of the spheres increases, the "peak" of $\text{TPS}_{50}$ shown in plot (a) diminishes. The diminishing effect comes due to the curse of dimensionality (\cref{fig:curse-of-dimensionality}), namely that in high dimensional space, all distances become very similar (as seen in plot (f)). In other words, for high dimensional spheres, it becomes very hard to identify the intersection point using $\text{TPS}_{50}$, as the distances become similar, and $\text{TPS}_{50}$ is unable to identify areas around the intersection point, as we saw happened in lower dimensions (\cref{fig:two-spheres-2d-3d-tps-scores}). It should be noted, however, that for high values of $d$, the intersection point has a $\text{TPS}_{50}$ score which generally is higher than all other values of $\text{TPS}_{50}$. Finally, we conclude that these results shown in \cref{fig:two-spheres-distance-to-int-point-vs-tps-scores} may indicate that the topological measure of polysemy may suffer when applied to high-dimensional (e.g. 300) data.

The measure of topological polysemy will further be used in the supervised polysemy prediction experiments of \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-supervised-polysemy-prediction}, where we create a model for predicting whether or not a word is polysemous. Next, we will look at Geometric Anomaly Detection, and in particular, how it performs when applied to word embeddings.

\subsection{Geometric Anomaly Detection}
\label{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-geometric-anomaly-detection}
In this subsection, we will apply the Geometric Anomaly Detection (GAD) (\cref{sec:geometric-anomaly-detection}) algorithm to the word embeddings from the SGNS-enwiki model. In particular, we will show the relationship between how GAD categorizes word embeddings into groups and whether or not a word is polysemous. Prior to this, we will motivate the use of GAD by visualizing GAD applied to the 3-dimensional \textit{Henneberg surface} data set, as used in the experiments of \cite{stolz2020geometric}. To implement GAD, we used similar packages to the ones used to implement topological polysemy in \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-topological-polysemy}, namely the ScaNN \cite{scann2020} approximate nearest neighbour algorithm, to speed up the nearest-neighbour computation, and \path{ripser} \cite{ctralie2018ripser} Python package, to compute Vietorisâ€“Rips complexes. We also included an option to use Ripser++ \cite{zhang2020ripserplusplus} (Ripser "plus plus") instead of \path{ripser}, a GPU accelerated version of \path{ripser}, but we would that the GPU overhead was too large and it was faster just to use the regular \path{ripser} Python package. 

Next, we apply GAD to the Henneberg surface data set, using the same hyperparameters used by \cite{stolz2020geometric}; we let the inner annulus radius equal 1.5, outer annulus radius equal 2 and the manifold dimension $k$ equal 2. The result is visualized in \cref{fig:gad-henneberg-3d}, and we see how GAD groups data points to the manifold, boundary and singular groups. In the 3-dimensional Henneberg surface data set, there are four 2-dimensional surfaces which intersect, as shown by the plot to the right (b) of \cref{fig:gad-henneberg-3d}, where the GAD algorithm correctly identified them (singular points). In addition to the singular points, the boundary points are also nicely shown in in both plots (a) and (b).

    \label{fig:gad-henneberg-3d}
\end{figure}

Following, we visualize the Henneberg surface data set with the $\text{TPS}_{50}$ score computed for each point. As shown in \cref{fig:gad-henneberg-3d-tps-50}, we see that the measure of topological polysemy fails to identify the singular data points, which we expect to have a relatively high $\text{TPS}_{50}$ score. In particular, the $\text{TPS}_{50}$ score is relatively high for points on the manifold, and lower for the boundary and singular points.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:gad-henneberg-3d-tps-50}
\end{figure}

We now apply GAD to the word embeddings from the SGNS-enwiki model. In particular, we will compute GAD of the words which have a WordNet entry, similar to the word embeddings used in the SGNS-enwiki experiments with topological polysemy in \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-topological-polysemy}. Since we do not know a good set of annulus radii parameters to use when computing GAD of the WordNet SGNS-enwiki word embeddings, we will instead default to a $k$-nearest neighbour approach, where we let the inner annulus radius equal to the distance to the $s$ nearest neighbour of each word, and similarly for the outer annulus radius, which we set equal to the distance to the $t$ nearest neighbour of each word. To compute GAD of the WordNet SGNS-enwiki word embeddings, we used the parameters $s=25$ and $t=500$. The number of words in each GAD group is shown in \cref{table:number-of-words-gad-polysemous-sgns-enwiki-wordnet}. From \cref{table:number-of-words-gad-polysemous-sgns-enwiki-wordnet}, we see that the number of polysemous WordNet words that fall into the singular group is particularly low; only 344 of 48880. In addition to this, we see that the number of words being categorized as "boundary" words is high. These two observations suggest that our inner and outer annulus radius, as well as the manifold dimension $k$, were not set correctly for we are working with. Keep in mind that the intrinsic dimensionality of the word embeddings are most likely higher than $k=2$, but due to the computational cost of setting $k > 2$ (due to Vietorisâ€“Rips complex creation), we will not set $k$ greater than 2 in this thesis.

    \label{table:number-of-words-gad-polysemous-sgns-enwiki-wordnet}
\end{table}

Furthermore, we visualize the result using a 2-dimensional UMAP embedding of the 10000 most common words of the the WordNet SGNS-enwiki word embeddings, labeled using the GAD groups, as seen in \cref{fig:gad-umap-2d-10k-most-common-wordnet-enwiki-words}. From \cref{fig:gad-umap-2d-10k-most-common-wordnet-enwiki-words}, we see that only a single word has been categorized as singular (the word "branch"), some words are categorized as manifold and the rest are categorized as boundary. The fact that most words are categorized as boundary further strengthens our hypothesis that the hyperparameters used to compute GAD are not correct. We also observe that \cref{fig:gad-umap-2d-10k-most-common-wordnet-enwiki-words} differs a whole lot from GAD applied to the Henneberg surface data set (\cref{fig:gad-henneberg-3d}), which could indicate bad hyperparameterization.

\end{figure}

We will investigate the effect of using different sets of hyperparameters when computing GAD of word embeddings in \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-supervised-polysemy-prediction}, where we will create supervised models for predicting whether or not a word is polysemous. Next, we will investigate algorithms for estimating the intrinsic dimensionality of word embeddings, and how it correlates with the actual number of word meanings.

\subsection{Intrinsic dimension estimation}
\label{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-intrinsic-dimension-estimation}
In this subsection, we will look at intrinsic dimension (ID) estimation algorithms (\cref{sec:intrinsic-dimension-estimation}) and apply them to word embeddings. In particular, we will apply ID estimation algorithms to the WordNet SGNS-enwiki word embeddings, used in experiments in \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-topological-polysemy} and \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-geometric-anomaly-detection}. We show the relationship between the estimated ID and the number of WordNet word meanings. To demonstrate the relationship between estimated ID and number of WordNet word meanings, we will use the LPCA (\cref{sec:id-estimation-lpca}), TWO-NN (\cref{sec:id-estimation-twonn}) and TLE (\cref{sec:id-estimation-tle}) algorithms. For each algorithm, we compute the estimated local intrinsic dimension by using the 200 nearest neighbour of each word. We plot the estimated IDs versus the number of WordNet word meanings in \cref{fig:intrinsic-dimension-estimation-vs-wordnet-synsets}, and we observe a similar behaviour shown in \cref{fig:tps-n-correlation-sgns-enwiki} and \cref{fig:tps-n-correlation-sgns-semeval}, namely that we see a clear trend when plotted against the number of WordNet word meanings. We also see that, the different ID estimation algorithms yield different results; LPCA estimates ID up to 120, while TWO-NN and TLE estimates ID up to 50 and 60. This result suggest that, we can not simply rely on a single estimate of the ID, it could be useful to use multiple ID estimates, as they are measured differently (see \cref{sec:intrinsic-dimension-estimation} for more details).
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{thesis/figures/intrinsic-dimension-estimation-vs-wordnet-synsets.pdf}
    \caption{Estimated IDs plotted against number of word meanings, using LPCA, TWO-NN and TLE ID estimation algorithms.}
    \label{fig:intrinsic-dimension-estimation-vs-wordnet-synsets}
\end{figure}

We have now shown the relationship between estimated ID and number of word meanings. In the next section, we will create supervised models for predicting whether or not a word is polysemous. We will use multiple sets of hyperparameters and all ID estimation algorithms specified in \cref{sec:intrinsic-dimension-estimation}, as well the topological polysemy (\cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-topological-polysemy}) and Geometric Anomaly Detection (\cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-geometric-anomaly-detection}) algorithms.

\subsection{Supervised polysemy prediction}
\label{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-supervised-polysemy-prediction}
In this subsection, we propose two supervised models to predict the number of word meanings. As we have seen in the previous subsections (\cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-topological-polysemy}, \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-geometric-anomaly-detection} and \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-intrinsic-dimension-estimation}), the number of word meanings seem to be more or less correlated with topological polysemy, Geometric Anomaly Detection (GAD) and intrinsic dimension (ID) estimation. For this reason, we propose two supervised model using lasso regression (\cref{sec:lasso-regression}) and logistic regression (\cref{sec:logistic-regression}), incorporating the results from topological polysemy, GAD and ID estimation. We chose to use lasso regression, because it has feature importance packed in the model. The feature importance part is important for us, because we would like to try multiple configurations of hyperparameters for each algorithm used to create the training data. The logistic regression model is trained using $\ell_1$-penalty, which allows the model to perform feature importance as well. The lasso regression model tries to predict the number of word meanings, while the logistic regression model performs binary prediction of whether or not a word is polysemous. We also attempted to create a multi-class (e.g. 1 meaning, 2 meanings, etc.) model using multinomial logistic regression, but it became apparent that the problem was too hard and we decided not to follow up with those experiments. Furthermore, we denote the lasso regression model as \textit{WME-enwiki} (short for \textbf{W}ord \textbf{M}eaning \textbf{E}stimation-enwiki) and the logistic regression model as \textit{BWME-enwiki} (short for \textbf{B}inary \textbf{W}ord \textbf{M}eaning \textbf{E}stimation-enwiki). Next, we will describe the creation of training data used for both supervised models, before going into detail of the training and evaluation process.

To create the training data used in the WME- and BWME-enwiki models, we used the word embeddings from the SGNS-enwiki model. In particular, we used the word embeddings that have a WordNet entry, resulting in 144 412 words. We denote these word embeddings as the WordNet SGNS-enwiki word embeddings. The number of word meanings (i.e. number of WordNet symsets) are used as labels $y$ for the WME-enwiki model, while the BWME-enwiki model have binary labels, $y=0$ if the word have exactly one word meaning, and $y=1$ if the word has two or more meanings.

To create the features of the training data, we first compute topological polysemy $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ of the WordNet SGNS-enwiki word embeddings. We compute $\text{TPS}_n(w)$ at for varying $n=10, 20, 30, \ldots, 250$ (step size of 10, leading to 25 values of $n$) and use them as features in the data. In addition to this, we compute the maximum, average and standard deviation of the birth values of the zero-degree persistence diagram computed by $\text{TPS}_n(w)$, leading to 3 additional features for each $\text{TPS}_n(w)$. In total, we get 25 (values of $n$) $\times$ 4 = 100 features from topological polysemy.

Following, we compute GAD of the WordNet SGNS-enwiki word embeddings. To compute GAD, we use the $k$-nearest neighbour version, similar to the experiments of \cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-geometric-anomaly-detection}; we let the inner annulus radius equal the distance to the $s$-nearest neighbour and the outer annulus radius equal the distance to the $t$-nearest neighbour. By using the $k$-nearest neighbour version of GAD, we are also in more control of how long it takes to compute GAD (setting the radius manually can lead to big and difficult computations of the Vietorisâ€“Rips complex, since some areas are more dense than others). The different choices of $s$ and $t$ are shown in \cref{table:supervised-polysemy-prediction-gad-configurations}, and leads to 23 different configurations of the inner and outer annulus $k$-nearest neighbours. We let the manifold dimension $k$ equal 2 for all words, even though the local intrinsic dimension for each word is likely higher than 2. This was done to make the GAD computation feasible within the computational resources at hand; we will revisit the manifold dimension choice when discussing future work in \cref{chap:conclusion-and-future-work}. For each configuration used in GAD, we create one feature for each GAD group (manifold, boundary and singular) by using one-hot encodings; e.g. if a word is categorized as manifold, then its value is equal to 1 and the rest are set to zero. In other words, we are left with 23 (configurations) $\times$ 3 (GAD groups) = 69 features from GAD. We also attempted to vectorize the persistence diagrams created by GAD using persistence images (\cref{sec:persistence-image}), but it quickly led to far too many features as we used each pixel in the images as a separate feature, and we were unable to train the WME- and BWME-enwiki models efficiently. We will revisit the use of persistence images when discussing future work in \cref{chap:conclusion-and-future-work}.

    \label{table:supervised-polysemy-prediction-gad-configurations}
\end{table}

Furthermore, we estimate the local ID of all WordNet SGNS-enwiki word embeddings, using the ID estimator algorithms in \cref{sec:intrinsic-dimension-estimation}. More precisely, we used the LPCA (\cref{sec:id-estimation-lpca}), KNN (\cref{sec:id-estimation-knn}), TWO-NN (\cref{sec:id-estimation-twonn}), MLE (\cref{sec:id-estimation-mle}) and TLE (\cref{sec:id-estimation-tle}) algorithms. For each of the algorithms, we formed a $k$-nearest neighbourhood around each word and estimated the local ID of the neighbourhood. We used the following values for $k$: 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200. The estimated local ID of each word is used as a feature in the training data, leading to 5 (algorithms) $\times$ 5 (hyperparameter sets) = 25 features from ID estimation. We used the \path{scikit-dimension} Python package \cite{scikitdimension2020} to estimate the local IDs.

In total, the training data has 100 (from topological polysemy) + 69 (from GAD) + 25 (from ID estimation) = 194 features. Following, we split the training data into three new distinct data sets (\cref{sec:train-val-test-splits}): training-, test- and SemEval test data sets. The new training data set consist of 95\% random words of the original training data set, where the 100 SemEval-2010 Task 14 target words (\cref{sec:analysis-of-embeddings-topological-polysemy}) are excluded. The test data set consist consist of 5\% random words of the original training data set, where the 100 SemEval-2010 Task 14 target words are excluded. The test data set will be used to evaluate the performance of the WME- and BWME-enwiki models. The SemEval test data set consist of the 100 SemEval-2010 Task 14 target words, and will be used to evaluate the performance using the WME-enwiki model, as well. We would like to emphasize that the training and test data sets do not have overlapping words, as we do not want to be training on words from the test data sets. The training data set consists of 137 098 words, test data set consists of 7 216 words and the SemEval test data set consist of 98 words (as 2 of the words are out of the SGNS-enwiki vocabulary). For each data set, we transform the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, as we do not want the WME- and BWME-enwiki models to be affected by different means and variances across the features. For the SemEval test data set, we use the SemEval gold standard to be the number of word meanings, while for the training and test data set we use the number of WordNet synsets as the number of word meanings.

Following, we trained the WME- and BWME-enwiki models using $k$-fold cross validation (\cref{sec:cross-validation}). We found $k=20$ to work well with out data, meaning that we use 6 855 words random validation for each fold in the cross-validation. For the WME-enwiki model, we cross-validated over 10000 values for $\lambda$, starting from $\lambda=0.0000001$ to $\lambda=0.01$. We found the most optimal value for the WME-enwiki model to be $\lambda=0.0000291$. For the BWME-enwiki model, we cross-validated over 10000 values for $\lambda$, starting from $\lambda=0.00001$ to $\lambda=0.01$. We found the most optimal value for the BWME-enwiki model to be $\lambda=0.000692$. To perform the cross-validation we used the \path{LassoCV} and \path{LogisticRegressionCV} classes from \path{scikit-learn} for the WME- and BWME-enwiki models, respectively. We used the sensitivity metric (\cref{sec:sensitivity}) to score the folds from the BWME-enwiki cross validation, as the sensitivity is intuitively the ability of the model to find all the polysemous words. For the WME-enwiki model, we used the default scoring of the \path{LassoCV} class. Results from training the WME-enwiki model is shown in \cref{fig:wme-enwiki-correlation-result}, where we see a weak correlation between the predicted number of word meanings and the number of WordNet synsets for both the training (a) and test data sets (b). The last plot (c) shows that the model is unable to predict the number of word meanings for the SemEval data set, which is not surprising, since we have trained using the number of WordNet synsets. We note, however, that we see clear trends in all plots.

    \caption{Predicted number of word meanings plotted against number of WordNet synsets and SemEval gold standard, using the WME-enwiki model.}
    \label{fig:wme-enwiki-correlation-result}
\end{figure}

By looking at the values of the coefficients of the WME-enwiki model, we see how the model prioritizes certain features over others. We visualize the top 10 most important features in \cref{fig:wme-enwiki-feature-importances}. From \cref{fig:wme-enwiki-feature-importances} we see that the features from topological polysemy for high values of $n$ are the most relevant for the model. The MLE and TLE intrinsic dimension estimators are also relatively relevant for high values of the $k$-nearest neighbour. The features from GAD are not in the top 10 most important features.

    \caption{Feature importances for the top 10 most important features of the WME-enwiki model.}
    \label{fig:wme-enwiki-feature-importances}
\end{figure}

To investigate the feature importances for the TPS, GAD and ID estimator features, we visualize its top 10 most important features in \cref{fig:wme-enwiki-feature-importances-tps-gad-estimated-ids}. From \cref{fig:wme-enwiki-feature-importances-tps-gad-estimated-ids}, we see that the $\text{TPS}_{250}$ features are especially relevant, show in (a). The GAD features from (b) show that whether or not a word is classified as a boundary or singular word is important, while whether or not a word is on the manifold is not as relevant. Lastly, we see that the MLE and TLE ID estimator methods yield important features for various values of $n$. It should be noted, that the feature importance shown in (a) and (c) are more important than the features shown in (b), as noted by the x-axis scales.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:wme-enwiki-feature-importances-tps-gad-estimated-ids}
\end{figure}

Some of the features from the WME-enwiki model were also set to zero, meaning that they are not used in the model. In particular, 48 of 194 features were set to zero, and most of them were various configurations of GAD which did not yield any interesting result (e.g. all words classified as boundary words). We have now looked at the result from training of the WME-enwiki model, and in particular, looked at its performance when predicting the number of word meanings and which features were important to the model. Next, we will look at the results from the training of the BWME-enwiki model. Results from training the BWME-enwiki model is shown in \cref{fig:bwme-enwiki-confusion-matrices}, where we see the result of predicting number of word meanings on the training (a) and test (b) data sets using confusion matrices (\cref{sec:confusion-matrix}). From \cref{fig:bwme-enwiki-confusion-matrices}, we get a sensitivity of 0.393 on the train data sets (a), meaning that the model is able to identify 39.3\% of the polysemous words. The test sensitivity (b) shows that the model is able to identify 39.4\% of all the unseen polysemous words. These results indicate that the model is unable to efficiently predict whether or not a word is polysemous, as we ideally would like the sensitivity on both the training and test sets to be at least 0.5 (or 50\%). By looking at the mistakenly classified polysemous test words from the BWME-enwiki model, we can get a feeling of which words it has a harder time with. Of the 1484 words the BWME-enwiki model predicted to be monosemous, we report the top 10 most common test words the model mistakenly classified as monosemous, namely the following words: "time", "age", "returned", "italian", "chicago", "gold", "tower", "jones", "unable" and "opposition". From these words, we do not see any particular pattern. Next, we will investigate the feature importance in the BWME-enwiki model, by looking at the coefficient values.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{thesis/figures/bwme-enwiki-confusion-matrices.pdf}

    \label{fig:bwme-enwiki-confusion-matrices}
\end{figure}

The feature importance of the BWME-enwiki model is shown in \cref{fig:bwme-enwiki-feature-importances}, where we can see the top 10 most important features. From \cref{fig:bwme-enwiki-feature-importances}, we see a similar pattern to the top 10 features importances from the WME-enwiki model, namely that the TPS features (for varying $n$) are most important, followed by the features from the ID estimator models.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{thesis/figures/bwme-enwiki-top-10-feature-importances.pdf}
    \caption{Feature importances for the top 10 most important features of the BWME-enwiki model.}
    \label{fig:bwme-enwiki-feature-importances}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, we look at the top 10 feature importances for the TPS, GAD and ID estimator features separately, as shown in \cref{fig:bwme-enwiki-feature-importances-tps-gad-estimated-ids}. From \cref{fig:bwme-enwiki-feature-importances-tps-gad-estimated-ids}, we see that the TPS features in plot (a) illustrate that high values of $n$ are generally more important than lower values. The GAD features (b) show a different situation to the top 10 features importances for GAD using the WME-enwiki model; whether or not a point is categorized as singular is important for predicting whether or not a word is polysemous, and the rest of the GAD categories are less important. One interesting finding is that the GAD singular features importances were negative (see plot (b)); we expected them to be positive, as it would make sense for them to be a positive contribution to whether or not a word is polysemous. Lastly, we see that the TLE and TLE ID estimator models yield important features for high neighbourhood values. Similar to the feature importances shown in \cref{fig:wme-enwiki-feature-importances-tps-gad-estimated-ids}, we note the fact that the feature importance shown in (a) and (c) are more important than the features shown in (b), as noted by the x-axis scales.
