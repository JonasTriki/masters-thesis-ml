\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
To conclude the thesis, we obtain meaningful clusters of word embeddings when we apply them to clustering algorithms and validate the result using internal cluster validation methods. Additionally, topological polysemy does not seem to measure the polysemy of words efficiently and consistently. We note that the topological polysemy method is a relatively new idea, and it requires more work to find out more about the algorithm and its results. In the next chapter, we will discuss our ideas for future work related to this thesis.
