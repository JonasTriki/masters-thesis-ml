Over the last few years, advances in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled us to learn more from textual data. To this end, word embedding models learn vectorized representations of words by training on big sets of texts (e.g. the entire Wikipedia corpus). Word2vec is a word embedding model which learns a single vector representation for each word it is trained on. However, by creating single vector representations for words, it becomes hard to separate between word meanings. Words with multiple meanings are called \textit{polysemous}, and determining the word meanings of a given word is a difficult problem in NLP. Traditionally, word embeddings from word2vec are analyzed using analogy and cluster analysis. In analogy analysis of word embeddings, it is common to show relationships between words, i.e that the relationship between \textit{king} and \textit{man} is same as that between \textit{queen} and \textit{woman}. Moreover, in cluster analysis of word embeddings, it is commonly shown that similar words cluster together, such as colours, names and countries. Additionally, recent developments in the field of topological data analysis (TDA) introduces a topological measure of polysemy, which attempts to identify polysemous words from their word embeddings. The goal of this thesis is to show how word embeddings traditionally are analyzed using analogies and clustering algorithms, and additionally, to use methods such as topological polysemy to identify polysemous words, using various word embeddings. Our results show that we are effectively able to cluster word embeddings into groups of varying sizes. Results also revealed that the measure of topological polysemy was inconsistent across word embeddings, and our proposed supervised models attempt to overcome and improve on this work.
