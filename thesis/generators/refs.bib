abstract = {We present two modifications to the popular k-means clustering algorithm to address the extreme requirements for latency, scalability, and sparsity encountered in user-facing web applications. First, we propose the use of mini-batch optimization for k-means clustering. This reduces computation cost by orders of magnitude compared to the classic batch algorithm while yielding significantly better solutions than online stochastic gradient descent. Second, we achieve sparsity with projected gradient descent, and give a fast ε-accurate projection onto the L1-ball. Source code is freely available: http://code.google.com/p/sofia-ml},

    bookTitle="Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook",
    year="2005",
    publisher="Springer US",
    address="Boston, MA",
    pages="321--352",
    abstract="This chapter presents a tutorial overview of the main clustering methods used in Data Mining. The goal is to provide a self-contained review of the concepts and the mathematics underlying clustering techniques. The chapter begins by providing measures and criteria that are used for determining whether two objects are similar or dissimilar. Then the clustering methods are presented, divided into: hierarchical, partitioning, density-based, model-based, grid-based, and soft-computing methods. Following the methods, the challenges of performing clustering in large data sets are discussed. Finally, the chapter presents how to determine the number of clusters.",
